== Oh My Der Die Das

This is an example of a RAILS3 mobile app that helps users learn German noun 
genders.

It is a multi-user site. Each user can create word lists and be trained on
those word lists.

When playing the game the entire word list is loaded to the client device
but as the game is progressed the scores for each word are synchronized with
the server so that next load the game state is preserved.

Notable technologies used in the site are

    devise              -   authentication
    cancan              -   authorization
    jquery mobile ui    -   mobile ui widgets
    backbone.js         -   javascript client application frameword
    coffeescript        -   makes javascript pleasant to write in
    jammit              -   asset packaging and compression
    heroku              -   deployment

The client application code can be found at

    app/coffeescripts/words.coffee

The compiled client code is

    public/javascripts/words.js


The main backend code is handled by two controllers
